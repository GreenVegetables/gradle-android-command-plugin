- Monkey task configuration is adjusted to make more sense. [#106](https://github.com/novoda/gradle-android-command-plugin/pull/106)

**Breaking changes in Monkey configuration**

Monkey task configuration is adjusted to make more sense. The following adjustments are needed if custom monkey configs are used.

This sample configuration 
```groovy
android {
    ...
    command {
        events 1000
        categories = ['android.intent.category.ONLY_ME']
    }
}
```
needs to be changed into these 2 possible options:
- Just surround with `monkey` closure. (Notice also that equals in `categories` is not necessary anymore)
```groovy
android {
    ...
    command {
        monkey {
            events 1000
            categories 'android.intent.category.ONLY_ME'
        }
    }
}
```
- If you have simple configuration, you can also prepend the fields with `monkey`
```groovy
android {
    ...
    command {
        monkey.events 1000
    }
}
```
